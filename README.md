Libguides (and Aeon) branding
=============================

This code determines the theming for MIT Libraries' hosted platforms from
Springshare and Aeon:

- https://libguides.mit.edu
- https://libcal.mit.edu
- https://libanswers.mit.edu
- https://libguides.mit.edu/staff
- https://mit.aeon.atlas-sys.com/

Each platform's branding materials are contained in a separate directory. For
each platform, there are usually three files:

1. custom-head.html - The stylesheets, javascript, and other head elements
   that control presentation and behavior.
2. custom-header.html - the HTML markup for the top navigation.
3. custom-footer.html - the HTML markup for the footer at the bottm of the
   page.

"Deploying" these files is a manual process: copying and pasting their
contents into Springshare's administrative web interface. For Aeon, the files
must be emailed to staff at Atlas for placing on their servers.
