======================

This code determines the theming for MIT Libraries' Springshare platforms:

- http://libguides.mit.edu
- http://libcal.mit.edu
- http://libanswers.mit.edu
- http://libstaff.mit.edu

Each platform's branding materials are contained in a separate directory. For each platform, there are usually three files:

1) custom-head.html - The stylesheets, javascript, and other head elements that control presentation and behavior.

2) custom-header.html - the HTML markup for the top navigation.

3) custom-footer.html - the HTML markup for the footer at the bottm of the page.

"Deploying" these files is a manual process: copying and pasting their contents into Springshare's administrative web interface.
