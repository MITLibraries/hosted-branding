# Aeon styles

These materials are applied to the [Distinctive Collections Request System](https://mit.aeon.atlas-sys.com/).

## Structure

These materials are in three files: HTML markup for the page header and footer,
and a custom stylesheet that includes custom overrides that are applied to the
basic Aeon styling (which itself leverages Bootstrap).

## Deploying

The "deploy" process for these materials involves submitting an updated file or
files to Atlas staff, who then place it on the server. Atlas staff may also make
changes to these files themselves, and may not communicate those changes to us.

As a result, if you ever need to make changes to these files, please check the
current production system to make sure we are not overriding recent changes.
